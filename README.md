##Synopsis

This is a package I created with matt that contains introductory level html files from the Monday class at epicodus.

##Code Example

The library contains multiple html files that show our favorite things as well as the first html file we collaborated on.

##Motivation

We created this project to get better at html, git, and collaboration to develop a foundation for becoming excellent programmers.

##Installation

Simply clone the files from github to access this package.

##API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

##Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

##Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
